My mother once said that everything can be a dumpling. Therefore, the respondent gathered my mother’s forty years of stuffing experience and summed up a daily and **versatile formula** for dumpling stuffing.

When you are tired of xx stuffing and want to change to a new taste but don’t know how to match vegetables, just take out this article and go to the supermarket to buy it accordingly.

At the same time, the end of the article will also list the exclusive tips for adjusting the stuffing, so that your stuffing is fresh enough! !

## The formula for all-purpose fillings is:

> Delicious stuffing = base dish (meat or egg) + taste dish 1+ taste dish 2+ special aroma dish

#### Bottom dish refers to meat, pork, lamb, beef, fish

#### Taste dish 1 refers to dishes with weak aroma and soft taste. Among them, a lot of juicy vegetables need to be squeezed out before filling.

> Such as winter melon, zucchini, pumpkin, loofah, eggplant, purple cabbage, cabbage, cabbage, vermicelli, soy products (old tofu, thousand sheets, fried tofu), etc.

#### Taste dish 2 means that the taste is a bit crunchy, and the aroma is slightly heavier than 1.

> Such as lotus root, water chestnut, white radish, carrot, broccoli, cucumber, fungus, corn, etc.

#### Dishes with a special aroma, as the name suggests, have a very strong aroma, and people who don't like to eat them will faint just looking at the name.

> Such as fennel, celery, coriander, shepherd's purse, celery, spinach, tomato, leek, mushroom and so on.

### Here are a few examples to see how it works in practice.

#### Basic meat + special aroma dishes

The vegetables here are the **protagonists**, with a unique aroma. The meat is the auxiliary responsible for the taste.

**fennel stuffing**

![Funnel Stuffing](https://ik.imagekit.io/tr5vjbpqp/p8073885a917401458-ss.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1673780897474)

* Remove the roots of fennel, soak in water with salt for 10 minutes, wash, drain, mince, and set aside.

* Add green onion and ginger water to the meat stuffing in 3 times, stir until fully absorbed, add salt, soy sauce, salt, monosodium glutamate, cooking wine, sugar, and beat vigorously in one direction.

* Finally, add sesame oil and beat well, then add fennel.


**Beef Tomato Stuffing**

* Add salt, sugar, chicken powder, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, pepper oil, and an egg to minced beef.

* Roast the tomatoes and peel them. Then cut into cubes, squeeze the tomato juice into the beef stuffing, and stir vigorously to let the beef absorb the tomato juice. This will make the beef taste smooth and smooth, and prevent the prepared stuffing from being too juicy.

* Finally, pour in diced tomatoes, chopped green onion and ginger, add sesame oil and mix well.

#### Meat + taste dishes

The aroma of the meat is **dominant**, and the food is the auxiliary of the taste, which makes the meat filling taste refreshing and not greasy.

**Mutton and Green Onion Stuffing**

![Mutton and Green Onion Stuffing](https://ik.imagekit.io/tr5vjbpqp/01PZ5E57B364FEB9130D54px.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1673780897527)

* Add salt, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and an egg to the minced meat and stir, add green onion and ginger water in small amounts several times, and stir clockwise vigorously until the water is completely absorbed.

* Sliced shallots, add pepper oil and stir, mix with mutton and stir well.

#### Advanced version: meat + taste dishes + special aroma dishes

*The main taste of the dumpling stuffing made in this way is still dominated by the special aroma dish, but the taste is richer than the first one.*

**Beef Carrot Onion Stuffing**

* Grate the carrots into shreds with a grater, chop them with a knife, and chop the onions.

* Heat the oil in a pan, sauté the chopped carrots and shiitake mushrooms until fragrant, and add a little salt to the base, a little is enough.

* Add an egg, salt, chicken essence, five-spice powder, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, white pepper powder, oyster sauce to the meat stuffing, add green onion and ginger water in small quantities, stir clockwise and add sesame oil to cover.

* Add fried carrots and onions, stir well and then open the package.

#### Finally, let's look at this formula again:

> Universal filling formula = base dish (meat or egg) + taste dish 1+ taste dish 2+ special aroma dish

When you master this formula, you don't have to rely on those ready-made recipes.

You can freely adjust your favorite dumpling filling according to the formula

You can even change a pot of prepared stuffing to the taste you want.

Cook many kinds of flavors in one pot as you wish! ! !
